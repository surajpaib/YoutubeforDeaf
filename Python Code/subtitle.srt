00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
BBC - David Attenborough - Wonderful World

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,000
I see green trees

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,750
red roses too.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
I see them bloom for me

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,850
and for you.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,920
And I think to myself

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,950
What a wonderful World!

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,850
I see the blue sky

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,850
White clouds

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,850
The bright blessed day

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,150
the dark sacred night

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,750
And I think to myself

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,550
What a wonderful World!

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,750
The colors of the rainbow

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,050
so pretty in the sky

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,750
There are also the faces of people passing

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,550
I see friends shaking hands,

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,550
saying "How are you doing?"

19
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,350
They're really saying

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,350
"I love you!"

21
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,150
I hear babies mourn,

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,550
I watch them grow

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,350
They'll learn much more

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,250
what I ever know

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,250
And I think to myself

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,450
What a wonderful World!
