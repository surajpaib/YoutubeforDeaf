00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 BBC - David Attenborough - Wonderful World 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 I see green trees 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.750
 red roses too. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.600
 I see them bloom for me 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.850
 and for you. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.920
 And I think to myself 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.950
 What a wonderful World! 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.850
 I see the blue sky 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 White clouds 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 The bright blessed day 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.150
 the dark sacred night 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.750
 And I think to myself 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 What a wonderful World! 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.750
 The colors of the rainbow 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.050
 so pretty in the sky 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 There are also the faces of people passing 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.550
 I see friends shaking hands, 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.550
 saying "How are you doing?" 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.350
 They're really saying 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.350
 "I love you!" 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.150
 I hear babies mourn, 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.550
 I watch them grow 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.350
 They'll learn much more 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.250
 what I ever know 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.250
 And I think to myself 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.450
 What a wonderful World! 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450
